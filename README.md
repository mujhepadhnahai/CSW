description of yourself and includes the following subsections:
Personal Information:
• Add a heading, "Personal Information," using the <h1> tag to introduce the 
section.
• Below the heading, use an unordered list (<ul>) to display your full name, age,
roll no., and nationality as individual list items (<li>).
• Add a clickable link to your LinkedIn profile using the <a> tag. The link text 
should be "View my LinkedIn Profile," and it should open your LinkedIn page 
in a new tab.
Educational Achievements:
• Use an ordered list (<ol>) to display your academic qualifications, such as your 
10th-grade, 12th-grade, and degree percentage. Also, use superscript and 
emphasis tags as required.
Contact Information:
• Add a heading, "Contact Me," using the <h1> tag.
• Display your phone number using the <a> tag with the tel: attribute. The 
clickable text should be your phone number.

address, ensuring it's properly formatted.
Add a heading, "My Image Gallery," using the <h1> tag to introduce the 

section.

• Insert three different images using the <img> tag. Each image should have an 

appropriate alt attribute describing the image in case it fails to load.

• Make each image clickable, linking to a larger version of the image using the 

<a> tag. The larger images should open in a new tab.

• Add a caption below each image.
